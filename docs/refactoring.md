# NeuroNest-AI Refactoring Project

## Overview

This document outlines the refactoring project for the NeuroNest-AI codebase. The goal is to standardize the agent architecture across all implementations (TypeScript core, Node.js backend, FastAPI Python backend) to ensure consistency, maintainability, and extensibility.

## Goals

1. **Standardize Interfaces**: Create consistent interfaces for agents across all implementations.
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Implement an event-driven architecture for agent communication.
3. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility with existing code.
4. **Improved Testability**: Make the codebase more testable through clear separation of concerns.
5. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation for the new architecture.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Agent Interface**: Defines the contract that all agents must implement.
2. **Base Agent**: Provides common functionality for all agents.
3. **Event Stream**: Facilitates communication between agents through events.
4. **Actions**: Represent operations that agents can perform.
5. **Observations**: Represent information that agents can observe.
6. **Agent Registry**: Manages agent types and instances.

### Event-Driven Architecture

The new architecture uses an event-driven approach where agents communicate through events:

1. **User Input** → Creates an **Observation**
2. **Agent** → Processes the observation and generates an **Action**
3. **Action** → May trigger other **Observations**
4. **Other Agents** → Process these observations and generate more actions

This approach allows for more flexible and decoupled agent interactions.

## Migration Plan

1. **Phase 1**: Update core interfaces and base classes
   - Create new interfaces and base classes
   - Implement event-driven architecture
   - Maintain backward compatibility

2. **Phase 2**: Update agent implementations
   - Refactor existing agents to use the new architecture
   - Add new capabilities enabled by the event-driven approach

3. **Phase 3**: Update client code
   - Update code that depends on the old interfaces
   - Gradually migrate to the new event-driven approach

4. **Phase 4**: Remove legacy code
   - Once all code has been migrated, remove deprecated methods
   - Clean up any remaining legacy code

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components
3. **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete workflows
4. **Backward Compatibility Tests**: Ensure existing code continues to work

## Documentation

- [Migration Guide](./migration-guide.md): Instructions for migrating from the old architecture to the new one
- API Documentation: Comprehensive documentation of the new APIs
- Examples: Sample code demonstrating how to use the new architecture

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Core interfaces and base classes
- **Week 2**: Agent implementations
- **Week 3**: Client code updates
- **Week 4**: Testing and documentation

## Conclusion

This refactoring project will significantly improve the NeuroNest-AI codebase by standardizing the agent architecture across all implementations. The event-driven approach will enable more flexible and powerful agent interactions, while the improved testability will ensure code quality and reliability.
